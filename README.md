### Task: Implement Angular Message Bar Component
 Create re-usable message bar component based on variants and colors provided in mockups.

- **Time Limit**: 4 hours
- **References**:
    - Functional Requirements: [MessageBar.md](design-docs/MessageBar.md)
    - Mockups: [mockups](design-docs/mockups) folder
- **Priorities**: Reusability, clean API, and component design (over pixel-perfect implementation or feature quantity).
- **Accuracy**: Reasonably accurate to mockups; pixel perfection is not required.
- **Colors**:
    - Red: #DB2525 (dark), #FEE2E2 (light)
    - Blue: #0471F0 (dark), #F0F7FE (light)
    - Green: #41BD56 (dark), #F2FEEF (light)
    - Yellow: #FFB31D (dark), #FFF7E6 (light)  
- **Tools**: Angular. If you use AI, please attach prompts used to the solution. If you consider using a library to implement the component, prefer Angular Material.
- **Solution**: Link to a GitHub repository containing the code with solution. The solution should contain an `.md` file containing a brief description of any additional features, use cases, or tests that weren't completed within the time limit, as well as AI prompts used (if any).
