## Guidelines
- Global message bars display nonmodal messages that inform users of updates or changes to system status.
- Contextual message bars are most often used in task flows and forms, providing users additional context or information about a task.
- Either can be used for critical system alerts or passive feedback.

## Positioning
- Component should be displayed within page flow (not as part of overlay)
